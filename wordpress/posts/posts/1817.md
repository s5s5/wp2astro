[XHTML 2 Working Group Expected to Stop Work End of 2009, W3C to Increase Resources on HTML 5](http://www.w3.org/News/2009#item119)

> 2009-07-02: Today the Director announces that when the [XHTML 2 Working Group charter](http://www.w3.org/2007/03/XHTML2-WG-charter) expires as scheduled at the end of 2009, the charter will not be renewed. By doing so, and by increasing resources in the [HTML Working Group](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/), W3C hopes to accelerate the progress of [HTML 5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5) and clarify W3C's position regarding the future of HTML. A [FAQ](http://www.w3.org/2009/06/xhtml-faq.html) answers questions about the future of deliverables of the XHTML 2 Working Group, and the status of various discussions related to HTML.
